# Topic Analysis of MeiCogSci Conference Abstracts

This is the data ans analysis for the abstract How Can Computers Help Us Understand Text? Topic Modeling on Example of MeiCogSci Abstracts preseted at MeiCogSci conference in June 2019. I was the only person working on this project, with occasional advice from other people.

This was the peliminary work for my master thesis. In my master thesis I am researching the attributes that make ideas spread. For this, I would need to find a way to track the spread of ideas from post to post. Topic analysis came as one of the possible ways of how to so this. So I decided to analyse another dataset with these tehniques to show the usefulness of it. I picked the MeiCogSci conference, since I assume that people attending this conference are interested in it.

## Preanalysis

These are some of the scripts, that I used to get data for analysis:

* Personality-IBM (using IBM's API in order to get the personality of each abstract author)

## Testing different models:

These are the different algoritms, that I also tested:

* Hierarchical Dirichlet Process

## Analysis

This is a list of analysis, that are present here:

* Human Research
* Time analysis
* Interdisciplinarity
* Personality
* Values
* Needs

## Additional files

In file constants.py I collected constants, that are constantlly used. 

In the file helping_functions.py I collected functions, that I frequently used. 

## Thanks
