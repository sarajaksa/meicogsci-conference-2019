... title: Understanding a Consumer’s Choice of Goods Made under Precarious Circumstances



Abstract

## Context

Consumption has become a primary tool for individual identity creation. It is one central element of our economic system and part of every citizen’s daily life. In the recent history, especially the textile industry was shaken by various scandals regarding slave like working conditions and child labor. Still, little effort from the producer’s side is needed to convince the consumer to buy again, just shortly after the outcry. This paper aims to understand, which mental and cognitive processes within the consumer take place that lead to the decision to overlook these scandals and keep buying the goods that are still precarious.

## Purpose

This thesis will be about the consumer’s choice in consumer capitalism, assuming that in this economic system, consumption is the major economic force, perpetuating the very system. The aim of the paper is to find out if and why the chosen interviewees of the Global North buy goods, especially textile ones that have shown to be from precarious working conditions in the Global South. This work shall be seen within the field of Cognitive Economics [1].

## Method

To research the underlying motivation and processes, the author decided to conduct a series of four interviews with four different individuals from the ‘Sinus-Milieus’ of ‘Expeditive’ and ‘Adaptiv-Pragmatische’ coming from the Global North. These interviews attempt to focus on two different levels of experience and questions: What is the individual’s narrative concerning consumption of precarious goods? What is the subjective experience when buying goods coming from precarious working conditions?

The author aims to take a qualitative approach such as Objective Hermeneutics. With the help of two scientists from Cognitive Science related fields, gathered data will be analyzed to understand the constructed reality of the subjects to identify overlapping inter-subjective patterns. In a second step, the subjective experience in the second person shall be described, to take a look at the cognitive processes taking place within the individuals [2]. 

## Results

Three major concepts are currently considered as hypothesis-giving for the analysis: ‘cognitive limitation’ [3], ‘cognitive dissonance’ and ‘imperialism’. It is expected that during the analysis, one of these concepts will be understood as conceptual core of the hypothesis. After the ‘hypothesis verification’ the author aims to interconnect the conceptual core and the gathered data to build a conclusive interpretation about the interviewee’s narrative and mental processes.
