... title: Embodiment after Direct Trauma



Abstract

## Context

Embodiment as a concept derives from philosophy, but it developed alongside scientific development and became a psychological construct, as well as very important psychiatric concept. It is explained as living, experiencing, sensing in and through one’s body, and being connected with one’s body and through one’s body to oneself and to others in relational contexts. Following the previous research that traumatized individuals often can experience their body-feeling differently then non-traumatized. it is hypothesized that individuals who undergo some kind of direct trauma have different embodiment experience than the general population, which is in its quality closely related to the nature of their trauma. 


## Purpose

It is important to give embodiment less mystified explanations, to connect it more with kinesiological experience of our bodies and their functions, and gain more insight into  
connection and disconnection of the kinesthetic feeling of the physical after some traumatic event. This research will focus on mentioned connections after the individual already had some kind of direct traumatic experience, and will try to examine the aftermath of such events present in body awareness, body consciousness, sense of ownership and agency, and body-mind connection, of traumatized individuals. Therefore, embodiment will be described by following factors: body awareness, body responsiveness, sense of agency and ownership, body-mind connection, and detachment or dissociation occurrence. 

## Method

Embodiment will be examined from a standpoint of already proven constructs that underlie its explanation, broadly in context of how one feels its own body, how connected to it he or she feels, how well connection between mind and body is present, and how much in control of its own actions he or she thinks is. For purposes of this research, a questionnaire was created in a form of a compilation of four already existing and proven as reliable questionnaires that measure mentioned constructs: BRQ, EEES, SBC, BCQ .

## Findings

Results show that traumatized individuals experience connection to their body differently and report a higher tendency to dissociation and loss of sense of agency then does the general population. Differences in the rate of those experiences are found between people who suffered from emotional trauma and ones who experienced sexual, where individuals who undergo sexual trauma experience losing a connection to their bodies. All traumatized individuals reported 

## Conclusion

Traumatized individuals have different experience with their bodies than the people who weren't traumatized. They have higher tendency to disconnection of a body and mind, and posses higher awerennes of their bodies and thier inner proceses. Embodiment is different in quality among people who went throguh different kind of trauma, where sexual trauma causes higher disociation tendency and sensitivity to inner body processes.
