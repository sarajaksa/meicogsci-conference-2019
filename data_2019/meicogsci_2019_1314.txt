... title: Is Your Man More Attractive than a Single One? Female Preference for Single Versus Partnered Males



Abstract

## Context
Mate selection is a complex process, that is largely affected by physical attraction.[1]  However, an extensive amount of research has proven that, there are also cyclical shifts in female preferences for certain physical and behavioral male traits based on their hormonal changes. Hormonal discharge occurring during the menstrual cycle enables women to take into account different traits and availability of potential partners. However it is not just availability of considered men which is important in mate selection, but also marital status of the female subject under question. 

## Purpose
The reason of conducting this study is to determine whether the man's label of marital status, changes perceived attractiveness among the single and the partnered women. At the same time we want to prove that the partnered women search for different traits during the cycle compared to the single women, which could be explained by the different attitude towards motherhood. Eventually we believe that outcomes will contribute to the existing findings and will allow us to understand the factors which affect decision making of women.

## Method
In this study we examine a variety of real male faces with the randomly assigned labels of their partner status. Female respondents evaluate five male traits - attractiveness, trustworthiness, masculinity, kindness, intelligence - of the displayed men. Data from respondents are compared between single and partnered respondents taking into account their fertility phase. Therefore our variables are the marital status of woman and man, fertility phase of women and rate of questioned traits.

## Results
We expect the results to show that women in the phase of  high fertility consider men with the “single” label as more attractive than the partnered ones, meanwhile during the phase of low fertility their preferences are more likely to be inclined towards the men with the “partnered” label. Greater difference in preference during the cycle stages is expected among partnered women as compared to single ones. [2]

## Implications
Results can be interpreted as, that women’s preferences are unintentionally affected by the chance of conception. Greater preference of single men during the phase of higher conception risk could be influenced by need to select a partner who is available to conceive a child.
