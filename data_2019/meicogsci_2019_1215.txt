... title: Preschool Children and Mindfulness



Abstract

## Purpose
Being able to regulate attention, emotion and having self-regulatory skills, are the main factors for school readiness. Children who have shown more self-regulatory skills in their childhood are predicted to be healthier, to show better academic performance and an increase in pro-social behavior [1],  [2].

## Research questions
Are children practicing mindfulness capable to substitute their dominant response over a subdominant response?
Do children behave differently in their home environment after practicing mindfulness?
What do educators think about practicing mindfulness and their observations on behavioral changes in children?

## Participants
Two groups of preschool children will participate in the research, all attending a public state kindergarten. Educators from the kindergarten will also be participating in the research. Educators in the intervention group will not need to have prior knowledge of practicing mindfulness. They will follow a specially prepared program, which will include mindfulness exercises for preschool children. The children in the intervention group will practice mindfulness for about 400 minutes within the eight weeks of the survey, on average ten minutes a day, from Monday to Friday. The practice will take place during their stay in kindergarten, when they take a rest, after lunch. The control group will practice their rest time as usual, by reading fairy-tales or playing quietly.  


## Measuring Instruments
The first part of my research will represent a test called Toy wrap/ Toy wait [3]. I will be measuring the latency of peeking and touching a gift before, and after practicing mindfulness. The second part of the study will represent a questionnaire about children’s behavior at home, answered by their parents. Last, the third part will contain statements from educators on their experience about practicing mindfulness with preschool children and their observations on possible behavioral changes in children.
