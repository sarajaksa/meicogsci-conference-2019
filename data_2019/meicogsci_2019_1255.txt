... title: Immersion â€“ an Altered Conscious State in Live Action Role-playing and Other Fields?



Abstract

## Context
My master thesis is focused on a psychological phenomenon called _immersion_ in Live Action Role-Playing, theatre, and psychodrama. Immersion in LARPing is defined as *"Immersion as a state (she was Immersed in the character) means the subjective experience of being someone else in an alternative, diegetic reality.''* [1] (text in brackets is added). LARPers often report experiencing this phenomenon during sessions. LARP-ing has many similarities with theatre and psychodrama, therefore it is reasonable to assume that something similar occurs in psychodrama and theatre. I begin my work from a LARP perspective on immersion and a comparison of descriptions of similar phenomenon between LARP, theatre, and psychodrama.  I've been working in the field of LARPs for the past two years, which is why I chose the LARP perspective as a starting point. 

## Purpose
Descriptions of similar phenomenon can be found in the theatre. [2] describes it as an altered conscious state, but the terminology used is vastly different. Also, there is no well-known concept that could describe this occurrence for all fields at once I am planning on examining each of these fields separately, to see whether they describe the similar phenomenon or even the same one but using different terms. Having a clear understanding of the phenomenon and relevant terminology allows for interdisciplinary work across the fields. 

## Method
 I will attempt to do this by performing a comparative analysis of the concept _immersion_. I start out with an overview of immersion in LARP. I will then gather descriptions of a similar phenomenon in theatre and psychodrama. After gaining an adequate understanding of the phenomenon in each of the fields, I will compare the concepts with one another. I will look for similarities, differences and anything out of the ordinary. 

## Expected Results
I expect to understand the phenomenon in each of the fields and I hope then to be able to form a concept of _immersion_ that can be used in all three fields. I will also review if the phrase _immersion_ is an adequate term, and then I might be able to bring about an option that will better reflect the essence of the phenomenon.
