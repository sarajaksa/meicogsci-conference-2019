... title: Novel Sound Learning through Philosophical Associations



Abstract

## Purpose

Second Language Acquisition Learners have to navigate novel sounds through the bias of their mother-tongue efficient ears, muscular control and development in producing these sounds, psychological pressures and fears associated with learning, novelty, society and self—which arise from philosophical features of sound, speech, society, and identity. I hope to explore the personal development and process of novel sound processing and producing new sounds by interviews.

## Background
The first main aspect of speech development is the biological fundamentals or biomechanics of speech. Secondly is the psychological connection with speech. 
The second aspect is psychological. This could include feelings and emotions identified with muscle control, process of change and learning, hearing novel sounds, association with one's own body in creating the novel sounds in speech. 
The final category is the philosophical area of sound, which would discuss and analyze certain thoughts or mental states in association with novel sounds and speech production of those novel sounds to the individual.

## Methods

One experiment would be to record sound and sight of non-native speakers producing a novel sound and a second language sound. Then have them watch a video of native speakers both in slow motion and real time, of the same sound. Then repeat copying this sound and asked to imitate the facial movements and expressions.

The second experiment would be to have an interview with non-native speakers and discuss the most difficult sounds in foreign language, and what seems the most novel to them. The second part of the interview would include asking them to reflect on what associations positive and negative, or mental states or ideas they have of those particular sounds. Then perhaps a third part of the interview would be to discuss their analysis of their familiar sounds in their mother tongue, and what associations they have with them, in contrast to the foreign tongue. 

## Research Questions

1. How might an individual experience with novel sound outside one's mother tongue, affect one's speech production?
2. How might a second language learner associate novel sounds in contrast with one's mother-tongue in a philosophical manner?
3. How might an individual progress or make desired progress in a second language with regard to a new technique involving the process of novel sounds and philosophical associations of that sound?

## Implications

I hope to create a kind of approach using this theory in helping adult Second Language Learners to hear new sounds more accurately, self-evaluate and compare foreign or novel sounds, psychological and philosophical exploration of sound and self, and enjoyment of the learning process.
