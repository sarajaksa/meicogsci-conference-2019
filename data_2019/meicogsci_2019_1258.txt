... title: Why Do Long-term Meditators Meditate?: Phenomenological Study of the Meaning of the Experience of Meditation for Long-term Meditators



Abstract

## Context
The practice of meditation has become widely present in our society and numerous studies of psychological and neurophysiological effects and neural correlates of meditation have been conducted over the years. Nevertheless only few phenomenological studies of the experience of meditation have been conducted [1].

## Purpose
In our exploratory study we will try to find out what motivates long-term meditators to insist in everyday practice of meditation. Our hypothesis is that long-term meditators find meaning of their practice also directly in the experience of meditation itself and not only in its effects such as achieving psychological balance. We are also interested in the structure of experience during different meditative states [2] which gives them meaning and motivation for everyday practice and if this experience gives them some insight.

## Method
We will do semi-structured interviews with five participants who meditate for at least 3 years on daily basis. Meditators will be of different age, gender, religion and will be practicing different meditation techniques. In the first part of the interview we will obtain their personal history of meditation practice and general information about their meditation practice and meditation technique. After the first part an interviewer and an interviewee will do approximately 15 minutes long meditation to be better able to recall meditative experience. In the main part of interview they will be asked why they meditate, what meditation means to them and which are those states during meditation which give meaning to their practice. Structure of experience during those states will also be examined.

## Conclusion
This exploratory study will give us better understanding of the meaning of meditation practice for long-term meditators from phenomenological perspective, of which we think is highly important because experience is primal part of meditation and motivation is what matters the most in the long run. From there on it would be interesting to further investigate what is the connection between experience of meditative states and insight.
