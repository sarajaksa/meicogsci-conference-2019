... title: Paradigms for Studying Constructive Memory



Abstract

The storehouse vs. the paleontologist metaphor of human memory would be contrasted in searching the unique sequences of constructivist approach to human memory. The main paradigms for studying constructive memory processes will be presented and discussed based on specific examples. The different constructive memory mechanisms that those research paradigms suggest, such as schematization, blending and memory reconsolidation will be critically discussed.
