Abstract

!!!!Categorization: Theories and Empirical Effects

It is broadly accepted that categorization (or grouping together entities which are otherwise seen as non-identical) is a basic cognitive ability. In the same time, none of the proposed theories of categorization has gained unanimity so far. The pros and cons of four major views on categorization (the so-called „classical” view, the prototype view, the exemplar view, and the theory view) will be discussed against the background of a large set of empirical phenomena. The students will be involved in practical exercises of planning, being participants in, and discussing the results of experimental studies of the most famous categorization effects.
