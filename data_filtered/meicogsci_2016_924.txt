... title: Creativity



Abstract

Human creativity has always fascinated psychologists and cognitive scientists. In the last fifty years or so, many cognitive aspects of creativity have been studied, and based on them many techniques for stimulating creativity have been developed. In this workshop, you will participate in a creativity-stimulating exercise that is based on one such technique. There are no prerequisites for participating, except to bring a fresh and open mind.
