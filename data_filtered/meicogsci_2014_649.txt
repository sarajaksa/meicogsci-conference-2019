... title: Whatâ€™s on your mind? How to design an experiment in Cognitive Biology



Abstract

One of the main problems in Cognitive Biology is that we have to infer mental processes from behaviour. The workshop should provide you with the necessary background to design a simple behavioural experiment. You will design your own experiment in a small group and discuss it with the other workshop participants.
