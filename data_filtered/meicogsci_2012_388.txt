... title: PHENOMENOLOGY OF THOUGHTS



Abstract

Thoughts are among most common modalities of experience and yet, they are poorly researched. Cognitive science's recent "discovery" of default mode networks and mind wandering has rekindled interdisciplinary interest in this area.  Lecture will present recent phenomenological insights as well as some pending questions concerning thoughts, thinking, communication and (only very briefly) language.

Some most common and most interesting modalities of experience of thoughts will be presented (no, we don't all experience thinking the same way!) and some pressing questions raised: Are thoughts one distinct class of phenomena or is it just a folk psychology term for a spectrum of very different experiences? Do we necessarily think in language? 

The lecture will conclude with an attempt to connect phenomenological insights with other areas of cognitive science, mostly neuroscience and education.
