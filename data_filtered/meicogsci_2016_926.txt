... title: Knowledge of language and compromised cognitive ability



Abstract

The workshop focuses on the nature of language deficit in AD patients with special focus on thematic-role assignment in verbs. It presents work by Manouilidou et al. (2009), where it is shown how difficult it is for AD patients to determine thematic roles with atypical verbs. Specifically, AD patients make numerous mistakes in psych verbs of the type fear-frighten, where the task requires recognizing the one who is experiencing the fear, be it in the subject (John fears the lion) or the object position (The lion frightens John).
