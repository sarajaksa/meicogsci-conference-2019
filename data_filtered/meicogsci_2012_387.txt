... title: Brain and culture (On the pragmatist philosophy of mind and neuropragmatism)



Abstract

The lecture will provide an overview of the key ideas of understanding of mental life in pragmatist philosophy (Peirce, James, Dewey, Mead, Quine, Rorty, Putnam) and the outline of contemporary theories of embodied (M. Johnson) and extended (A. Clark) mind developed within the pragmatist framework, as well as of current „neuropragmatism“. The focus will be on the relationship of brain (mind naturalized) and culture (mind linguistically constructed).
