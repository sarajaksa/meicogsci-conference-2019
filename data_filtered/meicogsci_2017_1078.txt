... title: Dualism and Neuroscience



Abstract

Philosophical assumptions affect the framing of research and the questions asked in neuroscience. In this workshop, we invite everyone to come along and discuss some of these assumptions. In particular, we will focus on the traces of dualism that can be found in neuroscience. In the first place, we will discuss brain-body dualism. As a case study, visiting graduate student Dylan Ross will present their work on maggot movement, which takes a monist rather than dualist approach to studying the brain-body system. We would like the workshop to be a discussion rather than a lecture and so we welcome contributions from everyone who has an interest in the subject area.
