... title: Analogy and Cognition



Abstract

During the workshop experimental support or rejection of the AMBR model will be discussed. Depending on the interests of the participants this could include topics like:
•	Context sensitivity of human cognitive processes
•	Constructive memory
•	Biases in judgment
•	Unconscious analogies
•	How emotions influence analogy-making
•	 Interaction between perception and thinking in the interpretation of ambiguous drawings
•	Embodied cognition view on analogy
The students will participate in active discussions and will be involved in experimental design tasks to test the model predictions. This will include both group work and individual assignments encouraging them to relate the theory with their own research plans.
