... title: Sensorimotor Processes in Empathy



Abstract

Empathy is an important social cognitive skill that enables us to share and understand the feelings of other people. In recent years, social neuroscience research has made considerable progress in identifying the neural mechanisms of empathy. Earlier accounts of neural underpinnings of empathy mainly stressed the role of shared affective representations between self and others. My talk will address the increasing body of evidence suggesting that empathy is also supported by sensorimotor processes.
