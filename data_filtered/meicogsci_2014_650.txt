... title: How can we measure conscious experience?



Abstract

The aim of this talk is to present an overview of research methods that could be applied in context of consciousness studies (i.e. verbal reports, objective and subjective measures of awareness, behavioural index of subjective experience, phenomenological methods as well as neuropsychological and psychophysiological markers of consciousness). All measures will be discussed in context of the current model of consciousness, discussing to what extent they help us to understand the mechanisms of consciousness as well as to measure awareness accurately.
