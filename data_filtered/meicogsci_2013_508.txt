Abstract

!!!!Shared Intentions and Normative Expectations

It has sometimes been argued in the literature that the decisive difference between humans and other animals is in the human capacity for shared intention. However, there is no consensus as to what shared intention really is. In this talk, it is argued that a distinctive feature of shared intention is that it involves a particular kind of expectations between the participants.
