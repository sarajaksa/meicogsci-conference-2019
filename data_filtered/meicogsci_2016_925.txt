... title: Rules of Word Formation and Compromised Cognitive Ability



Abstract

The talk discusses the status of various word formation rules by examining the speakers' perception of pseudo-words that violate these rules (data from English, Greek and Slovenian). Special emphasis is placed on the agentive deverbal nominalization in Slovenian (e.g. bralec "reader") and the pertaining word formation rules regarding thematic roles, aspect and grammatical category. The off-line and on-line lexical decision test developed for Slovenian is used with healthy and language impaired speakers (MCI, AD). The results reveal significant differences among the specific types of rules as well as among these groups of speakers.
