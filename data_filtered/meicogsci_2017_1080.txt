... title: Where Neuroscience Meets Anthropology: Neuroplasticity in Cultural Contexts



Abstract

Modern anthropology is built on an intellectual foundation that attempts to understand behavior from the perspective of both, cultural and human biological systems. Over the last decades, neuroscience has become increasingly influential on how we explain behavior. Methodological advancements in neuroscience tempt us into seeing behavior as a linear extension of brain processes. Yet behavioral substrates unfold at several explanatory levels in a dynamic way. In addition, brain processes and structures are subject to neuroplasticity, i.e. the nervous system can change and reorganize itself throughout life in response to environmental influences like cultural context, social relationships, and historic events. Thus, neuroplasticity provides contextual (cultural) as well as historically dependent (previous experience) mechanisms to shape the neural system and thereby modulating behavior. It is towards this end that I will argue for the integration of anthropological and neuroscience research. By way of example, I will discuss new theoretical developments, hypothesis-testing strategies, and cross-disciplinary methods of observation and data collection. To my mind, the exigency of integrating anthropology and the neurosciences is imminent and anthropologyâ€™s role in an emerging interdisciplinary science of human behavior will be of paramount importance.
