... title: Who's Afraid of Neuroscience?



Abstract

There is a new buzzword prefix being attached to everything from science and sociology to law and linguistics. The word that is at the center of all the buzzing is, of course, "neuro". But, as a famous uncle once said, with great power comes great responsibility. In this case, it is the responsibility of the current and especially future practitioners of the all arts -neuro to arm themselves with not just technical knowledge but also to vaccinate themselves against all the various ways their field of study is being misused and twisted for less noble pursuits. Following not far behind the steady increase of neuroscience’s popularity is also a counter-movement composed of a heterogeneous mix of mental illness denialists, wayward dualists, punitive legalists and Chicken Littles’ of all stripes warning that the sky is, indeed, imminently falling. In this lecture we will take a critical look at these anti-science movements, their origins, connections to neuroscience and also examine where their logic falters.
