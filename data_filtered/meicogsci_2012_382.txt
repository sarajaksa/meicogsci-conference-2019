... title: Analogy and Cognition



Abstract

In this talk analogy-making is viewed as central for human cognition. On the bases of the DUAL cognitive architecture and the AMBR model of analogy-making it will be demonstrated how the same mechanisms used for analogy can also model cognitive processes such as memory, perception, and judgment. This will allow for an integrated view on human cognition and understanding the interactions between various processes.
