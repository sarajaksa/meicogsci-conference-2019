... title: Science in Slovenia - Main Characteristics and Challenges



Abstract

Slovenian scientific achievements date back a few hundred years ago, but they are mostly connected to Slovenian scientists working abroad. This year the University of Ljubljana celebrates its one-hundred-year anniversary while the Jožef Stefan Institute, the country’s biggest research institute, was established 70 years ago. Innovation characteristics of Slovenia show excellent scientific achievements of the small country, big investments in research and development in the Slovenian industry and several problems in the transfer of knowledge from academia to society. 30 years ago, Slovenia doubled its government investments in science, yet from that point, financial investments have been decreasing. Indicators of scientific excellence show that in last 15 years Slovenia has been very successful and has substantially overcome the EU average.
