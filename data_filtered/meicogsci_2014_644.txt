... title: Can we blend superficially dissimilar episodes while remembering?



Abstract

The talk will go through different mechanisms that are supposed to underlie the constructive memory (i.e. schematization and blending). The focus will be on blending of superficially dissimilar episodes based on a shared structure. Empirical evidence demonstrating that people prefer to blend structurally rather than superficially similar episodes will be discussed in order to clarify the process of reconstructing our past.
