... title: DRAWING A MAP OF ONE'S EXPERIENCE (An introduction to EXPERIENCE SAMPLING and other approaches of phenomenological inquiry)



Abstract

We will briefly survey the basic ideas behind the phenomenological inquiry: Why we need to investigate our lived experience? (Don't we know all there is to know already?) What kind of data we get out of it?... How? The basics of phenomenal data gathering techniques will be discussed.

Main part of the workshop will be dedicated to experience sampling method. We will discuss and try both versions: qualitative, dialogical descriptive experience sampling (DES) and quantitative, ready-for-smartphone-app version called simply experience sampling (ES). If opportunities will allow, we will make a small inquiry, testing the amount of mind wandering of conference participants.
