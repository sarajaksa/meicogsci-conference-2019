... title: Expert Performance: Merely Automatic Skills?



Abstract

A growing number of studies is dealing with the topics that are at the intersection between philosophy of sport, philosophy of mind and cognitive science. According to classical cognitive science approach athletes are processors of information and intentional movements are set up in advance by a rule or command structure (“motor program”). The embodied cognition approach puts much greater emphasis on the role of the body, is bottom-up and takes the primacy of perceptual and motor processing. It provides a framework to investigate the kinetic-tactile processes that were previously pretty neglected area of research. According to the embodied approaches knowledge emerges through the agent's bodily engagement with the environment. Some researchers (e.g. Dreyfus) think that for experts who have gone true a long training regime, skillful behavior and knowledge-how do not need additional conscious awareness. In the talk I will focus on the role of movement and action in sport, point to the interdependency between theoretical and practical  knowledge and suggest that there is still a role for consciousness in expert performance.
