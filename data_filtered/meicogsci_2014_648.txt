... title: Why do woodpecker finches use tools?



Abstract

Woodpecker finches belong to the famous Darwin’s finches and use twigs to pry arthropods out of tree holes.  Why they do that, seems obvious. However, in a famous quote the Nobel Prize laureate Niko Tinbergen stated that “why does an animal do that?” can be answered in four different ways (focusing on causation, function, ontogeny or phylogeny). In my talk I would like to exemplify why it is important to integrate all 4 Tinbergen’s levels, when we study the cognitive aspects of animal behaviour.
