... title: Activation of the Mirror Neuron System by Emotional Facial Expressions



Abstract

Following a thorough review of existing research and related literature, an analysis of fMRI data using FSL software will lead to identification of brain areas specific to processing of emotional facial expressions.

The investigation was conducted on 30 accounting and finance managers (50% women) in business firms in Slovenia. Participants’ average age ranged from 24 to 52 years (37 years on average), and their work experience ranged from 1 to 26 years (12.8 years on average). They had an average of 17 years of education, and most of them held a master degree in business, economics, accounting or finance. 

The subjects participated in an approximately two-hours long fMRI recording at the Centre of Clinical Physiology, Medical Faculty, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia. The recording included various tasks including the one we are interested in: the participants were asked to observe videos of actors expressing different emotional states (anger, disgust, happiness, surprise, neutral) or a moving geometric shape as control.

I will compare and contrast various conditions among themselves, and with previous research, in order to identify areas specific to emotions [1]-[3]. Those, presumably, part of the mirror neuron system [4]. My goal is to localize the latter and elucidate its involvement in processing emotional expressions.
