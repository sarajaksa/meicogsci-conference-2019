... title: The significant correlation between potencies of tryptamines to block the NMDA channel and their potencies to block the ifenprodil site



Abstract

Abstract 

To decipher medical functions of drugs and their effects on treating certain neurodegenerative disease in pharmacotherapeutics, Structure Activity Relationship (SAR) study investigates the interaction of the mechanisms of drugs tryptamines (Ts) with the N-methyl-D-aspartate(  NMDA) receptors. Melatonin, Serotonin, LSD and DMT as well as many other members of the tryptamine family, derived from an amino acid called tryptophan very known as tryptamines, play critical role in different clinical treatments. SAR study is characterized, in this lab, by its concerns in the correlation between the effect of drugs on human and its molecular structure. This correlation is assessed based on series of molecules; each has its own structure characteristics which describe its biological activity.  As a type of ionotropic glutamate receptor, NMDA receptors play significant roles in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity and considered to be targets of therapeutic interest, including neuroprotective drugs. Building on a long experience with compounds acting as inhibitors at NMDA receptors, our lab became interested in [3H]ifenprodil binding. Ifenprodil specifically is being under investigation due to its effect on inhibiting glutamate (GluN1) and GluN2B NMDA receptor subunits, and to its potential use in the treatment of various neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s, and Alzheimer’s disease. However, ifenprodil as NMDA receptor antagonist, which easily crosses the blood-brain barrier, may cause behavioral as well as physiological effects. Perceptual alterations, hypotension, dysphoria are manifested as a result of low doses of such drug, whereas higher doses cause other behavioral manifestations such as hallucinations, confusion, agitation, paranoia, and excitement. Such severe side-effects which often lead to memory impairment and disturbance of logical thinking have up to now limited the use of NMDA receptor antagonists as therapeutics. Selective inhibitors of NMDA receptors with the NR2B subunit seem to have a more favorable therapeutic index. Therefore, SAR studies at this site may result in pharmaceutical leads to the treatment of highly relevant brain diseases without producing intolerable side effects. In the project of our lab, we try to test up about 64 different tryptamines as inhibitors to find out how they interact with [3H] Ifenprodil binding to rat brain membranes. Since tryptamines have been shown to block the NMDA receptor (Berger 2000 Neurosci Lett 296:29; Berger et al 2012, Current Medicinal Chemistry, in press), the next step now is to find out by which site(among the 4 NMDA subunits). Tryptamines might easily block this ligand-coupled ion channel by going directly into the channel, but they might also block by interacting with the "Ifenprodil-site". Detailed structure/activity relationship (SAR) studies have been already performed at the channel binding site; now, some more studies at the ifenprodil site are following by screening different tryptamines at NMDA, 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A receptor; as a comparative binding and modeling study. Preliminary results point to a significant correlation between potencies of tryptamines to block the NMDA channel and their potencies to block the ifenprodil site. To name but few, 5-Carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and serotonin at 5-HT 1A receptors, and 2-Me-4,7-Cl2-T (1.2 µM) and 2,7-Me2-4-Cl-T (2.0 µM) are tryptamines screened to have strong potencies on these receptors. Carrying out this study, the computing tools MOE 2009.10 and the statistical software SYSTAT (Version10.2) have been used. The data of this research were transformed into negative decadic logarithm and subjected to Quantitative Structure-Active Relationship (QSAR) modeling.
