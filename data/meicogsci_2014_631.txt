... title: Can EDA Synchrony Differentiate Between Attentive and Non-attentive Listening?



Abstract

!!!! Can EDA Synchrony Differentiate Between Attentive and Non-attentive Listening?

The current study is designed to assess whether empathic synchrony and skin conductance (EDA) synchrony appears during attentive listening. Prior studies by Marci et al[1] showed that perceived empathy of counsellors and skin conductance of patients and counsellors showed positive correlation during sessions. Zaki et al[2] showed that verbal information is critical for empathic accuracy (EA). EA is the level in which people can judge the emotional state of another person. I hypothesize that there is a connection between EDA and EA. In the current study participants are required to view audio/visual footage, while being distracted in order to evaluate what effect distraction has on EA and EDA.
