... title: Assessing attentiveness based on EDA-synchrony



Abstract

A possible way of measuring emotional responses in humans is electr-dermal activity (EDA). We are interested in finding out whether and how this may be used in the realm of attention. 
The current study is designed to assess whether empathic synchrony and skin conductance (EDA) synchrony appear during attentive listening. Prior studies by Marci et al[1] showed that perceived empathy of counselors and skin conductance of patients and counselors showed positive correlation during therapy sessions. 
Zaki et al[2] showed that verbal information is critical for empathic accuracy (EA). EA is the level in which people can judge the emotional state of another person. 
EA is positively correlated to attentive listening. I hypothesize that there is a connection between EDA and EA. In the current study participants are required to view audio/visual footage. The control group is distracted in order to evaluate the relationship between EA and EDA.
