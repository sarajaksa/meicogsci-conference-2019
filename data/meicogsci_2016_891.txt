... title: Subjective Experience Of Different Personality Types



Abstract

!!Introduction
Pristine inner experiences are salient phenomena (including seeings, hearings, inner speakings, tickles, sensations, feelings, etc.) that are directly apprehended by people in their everyday environments. [1] At every moment, a person selects/creates some very small number (often just one) of those potential experiences to form that momentâ€™s actual pristine experience. Different people do that in different ways. [2] 
The aim of this study is to examine inner experiences of different personality types - based on Jungian personality theories. Isabel Briggs Myers and Katherine Briggs developed his theory and created 16 types combining 8 Jungian functions. The MBTI is an instrument to determine an individual's personality type based upon C. G. Jung's theory of psychological type. [3]
!!Methods
Data will be obtained from 48 participants (3 for each personality type) using Descriptive Experience Sampling (DES), a method for exploring inner experience. DES subjects carry a random beeper in natural environments; when the beep sounds, they capture their inner experience, jot down notes about it, and report it to an investigator in a subsequent expositional interview. [2] Each participant will record his subjective experience for two weeks.
I consider that this research can be used to evaluate the Jungian personality theory .
