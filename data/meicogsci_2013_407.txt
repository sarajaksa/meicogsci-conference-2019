... title: Eye tracking on art paintings - differences between abstract and realistic paintings



Abstract

Theoretical concepts
Eye tracker is a device for measuring positions and movement of the eye. It is widely used in research of the visual system, which includes visual perception [3]. Differences in human gaze behaviour can be studied by analyzing fixations and saccades. Fixations are the periods when the eyes are relatively stable and visual information is gathered, while saccades are fast eye-movements which bring the fovea from one fixation point to another [1]. In paintings, the viewer’s eye is easily caught by figures presented in a picture. Although gaze behaviour during picture viewing is affected by visual features, cognitive factors are also important, for example person’s knowledge about the picture [2]. Eyetracking could be used when we would like to observe gaze patterns of two types of art - abstract and representational. Representational art consists of pictures that depict some recognizable thing or scene. It includes portraits, still-lifes, and landscapes. Precisely, it includes realist art, which attempts to reproduce the actual appearance of the things depicted. Abstract art uses a visual language of form, colour and line to create a composition which may exist with a degree of independence from visual references in the world .

Aim of the study
The aim of the study is to test hypothesis that there are differences in perception of abstract versus representational, more realistic paintings. 
Hence, I want to compare whether people look diversely at different styles of art pictures, that is why I choose abstract cubist paintings  and more realistic paintings. 
Methods
Gaze patterns were measured on iView eyetracking device where pictures were presented on a 19-inch computer screen. 9 point calibration was performed before experiment. 16 volunteers participated in a task, which was 4 minutes long. In that time, 27 pictures were presented, of which there was 8 pairs of pictures with the same theme painted in different style and 11 distractor pictures. Each picture was presented for 10 seconds and there was a fixation cross between each. Participants had the task to look at the pictures freely.

Expected results
I expect to find differences in eye gaze patterns regarding different styles of picture. In abstract-style paintings I expect more fixations with shorter duration, while in representational-style paintings less fixations with longer duration are going to be observed. I expect that because i think that we view these two kinds of pictures  differently – in realistic paintings we see what it is clearly painted, while in abstract paintings we somehow composeing picture like a puzzle .  I will analyse the data of which picture style, number of fixations and duration of fixations are crucial for analysis. A two sample t-test is going to be performed to test whether there are differences in perception of abstract versus representational pictures. 

Interdisciplinarity
The study focuses on human perception which is important topic in cognitive psychology. Not much has been done on that topic until now, although nowadays there is increasing interest in that field.I believe this research is also important for understeanding art perception, in the field of art history,and for a number of artists who are interested in perception of art or “how we look” pictures.
