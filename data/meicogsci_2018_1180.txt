... title: Lexical Processing of Complex Pseudo-words in Patients with Alzheimer's Disease.



Abstract

## Context
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common etiology for dementia . It affects cognitive performance of elderly adults. Previous research reports subtle  language impairments in individuals specifically in domains related to lexical meaning. It has also shown that progressive decline in language can be investigated by looking for subtle anomalies in EEG activity. 
## Purpose
Given that language performances in individuals with cognitive impairment are often subtle and unclear some researchers have claimed that their performance depends not so much on their language knowledge but rather on the task [2]. Patient performance deteriorates with increased task complexity, an indication that other-than-language cognitive systems, such as executive functions, might be interfering in language processing. The purpose of this research is to investigate the role of executive functions in lexical processing of pseudo-words that violate various principles of word formation in Slovene. The task represents complex situation in which individuals will be presented with lexical decisions that demand conflict resolution.
## Method
The role of executive functions will be investigated by looking for subtle anomalies in EEG activity.  The focus will be on induced power changes in oscillatory activity, generated by the onset of target pseudo-word. I'll be examining oscillatory activity in theta (3-5 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz) and beta (15 – 20 Hz) frequency ranges given that prior studies have implicated these bands in various aspects of language processing [1]. Electrodes of interest will be determined by Hagoort's neurobiological model of language. The model is extending beyond the classical core language regions and gives great importance to brain connectivity. According to Hagoort, modalities such as executive functions are part of language comprehension [3].
## Results
Given the examined literature I expect the oscillatory activity in patients with AD to be attenuated which would indicate that lexical processing is slower. The comparison between pseudo-words and words within AD group could imply on interference of executive functions when complex lexical decision is made. If I can show specific electrophysiological correlates in AD patients with psycholinguistic approach it could represent another potential method for determining biomarkers for early detection of AD.
