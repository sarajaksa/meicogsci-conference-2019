... title: "Ask the Body: Utilizing Movement to Investigate the Communication of Emotion Experience"



Abstract

##Context
Emotion experience: a concomitant of the awareness of one’s emotions while those emotions are occuring [1]. Emotion experience is shaped within the confines of the body; the apparatus that paradoxically evades and simultaneously reveals an understanding of self. Still, it is often believed that the body merely eludes to the manifestations of emotion experience, especially when not categorized as an involuntary physiological response [2]. What does an arbitrary bend of the knee have to do with elated joy? More than one could ever imagine...especially in the context of dance.

##Purpose
The body’s movements and its emotion expressive affordances, enable the investigation of nonverbal aspects of the triadic message exchange between the choreographer, the dancer and the audience [3].To explore the particular intersection of phenomena: emotion experience, movement (dance), and communication, this experiment utilizing a non-verbal communicative choreographic process to investigate the efficacy of the communication of one’s emotion experience though movement. 

##Methods
During the experimentation period, the choreographic process takes place in two parts: the kinematic structure of the movement and the refinement of the movement. Each dancer is surveyed on their emotion experience using a scale-based assessment, as well as interviewed in order to evaluate their ability to understand the intentions and emotions of the choreographers.

##Results
The results will reveal the effectiveness of nonverbal communication of emotion experience between the choreographer and the dancer by comparing the survey responses between the two groups of dancers who received verbal communication, and those who did not. Specifically, the results will demonstrate dancers’ ability to understand the emotions and intentions of the choreographers.

##Implications 
This study unfurls the assumptions and uncertainties about the body and its movements as a constituent of thought--elucidating how effective we can communicate even the complexities of emotions, utilizing the body as an explicit tool of communication, and ultimately share those emotional experiences that arise in the body’s movements with others successfully.
