... title: On the Impact of Cognitive Science Terminology on Interdisciplinary Knowledge Creation Processes as Analyzed with the Example of Reinforcement Learning



Abstract

The (interdisciplinary) cognitive science community is flooded with loaded terms, such as “behavior”, “reward”, “input” or “output”. What scientists *want* to communicate when using such terms, and what they *do* communicate to peers of neighboring disciplines with overlapping terminology diverges [1]. Such phenomena are analyzed by means of philosophical frameworks such as constructivist theories of language and thought. 
One prominent manifestation of this phenomenon at the intersection of psychology (PSY) and artificial intelligence (AI) will be investigated: “Reinforcement Learning” (RL) and what RL respectively is understood to be. The objective is to investigate language-related and theoretical components in the knowledge creation processes both within AI and PSY, and then in interdisciplinary collaborations on RL.
Borrowing terminology of speech act theory [2], research involving RL can be characterized by locutionarily identical but illocutionarily and perlocutionarily diverging scientific nomenclature and such mismatches can be expected to affect the scientific results. 

Reaching authoritative conclusions about a phenomenon as intangible as the difference in meaning created by a divergence between the *literal* use of a scientific term and the *implicit* theoretical connotations conveyed constitutes an effort facing serious challenges. However, the use of multiple scientific methods aims at approaching conclusive statements.

This multi-method investigation comprises of two steps, first, a theoretical and qualitative approach to explicate a theoretical grounding, followed by empirical experimentation with a computational model consistent with said grounding:
-	descriptive literature research (analyzing key journals and glossaries in PSY & AI) and meta-literature comparisons (using e.g. ProQuest or Scopus)
-	computer simulations (using one tractable RL model to assess the influence of rather PSY- or AI-inspired conceptualizations – of e.g. “behavior” or “reward” – as carried out by different structural representations and formalization of parameters).

Indeed, the very instance of a psychologist as myself, who is studying cognitive science and experiments with AI-inspired computer simulations, might be viewed as a variation of the research topic. This combination – as a further assessment of the phenomenon itself – might also produce interesting insights regarding the field of interest.
