... title: Setting the Groundwork for the Research of Pleasure by Using SSVEP



Abstract

## Introduction

Steady-state visually evoked potentials (SSVEPs) are defined as a distinctive electrical activity generated by the brain as a response to repetitive visual stimuli [1]. Usually, EEG is used to record SSVEPs due to its cost-effectiveness and good time resolution [2]. Characterized as having an excellent signal-to-noise ratio and stable spectrum, SSVEPs are applicable in a wide range of cognitive and clinical domains [2]. Many successful applications already exist [2], but novel practices are still emerging. One domain that could also benefit from SSVEPs is the research of pleasure, which presents a focal theme for this project. Despite the popularity of the topic, a lot remains unknown in terms of how pleasant experiences change the ongoing brain activity. The purpose of this pilot study, therefore, is to search for the correlation between brain activity and the level of pleasantness by using the aforementioned techniques. Specifically, our quest is to find SSVEP frequencies that produce noticeable responses in brain regions linked to emotions and to test whether they could form a basis for distinguishing between experiences of a different valence.

## Method

We conducted an EEG experiment with 28 subjects (8 women, mean age = 25.11) by using the SSVEP protocol. A subject was first interviewed for basic demographic data and medical condition. After the interview, the first part of the experiment began, which required from the subject to concentrate on square shaped visual stimuli that alternated color with different frequencies so that SSVEP responses could be measured. In the second part, the subject underwent the same procedure, with an additional requirement of drinking samples of different concentrates of sweetness and saltiness before concentrating on the visual stimuli. After each iteration, the subject had to rate the pleasantness of the taste experience on a scale from one to ten.

## Expected results

As the analysis still has to be done, we can only provide an estimate of the results. We predict that most SSVEP activations in the brain are going to be limited to the visual cortex, yet some might be linked to emotional areas. From the latter, we would ideally discover a differentiation between a positive and a negative gustatory experience. We hope that the acquired knowledge helps us lay a foundation for future research on how pleasure manifests itself in the brain.
