... title: Face Recognition



Abstract

Face recognition is a subset of cognitive processes associated with template recognition. In my research, I come from templates theory based on bottom-up processing theory. The most important cognitive functions are: long-term memory and work with it and search in templates.

My goal is to execute an experiment in order to determine the effectiveness of face recognition attributes like age, gender and race. [1] The experiment plan to be executed on a group of 30-50 participants which will be divided into 2 age groups. There will be online questionnaire where will be presented images from FG-NET aging database [2].

The cross-race effect (CRE) is a phenomenon in which individuals have better memory for faces of their own race than for faces of another race [3] This phenomenon was further investigated by an experiment published last year [4]. 

Results of the experiment will be analyzed and presented that it could be later on compared with machine recognition results.
