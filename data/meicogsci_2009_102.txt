... title: Darwin, The Functionalist Approach to Modern Psychology and the Central European Heritage



Abstract

The talk shall start form the basic structure of Darwinian theory with its emphasis on variation selection, and the retention of selected elements. In modern psychology, this structure lead to three different versions of Darwinian psychology.  The fist one emphasized the adaptive nature of mental life, the second the idea of development, both in the animal kingdom and in individual life,  and the third the study of individual differences.  

The Central European tradition excelled in two of these. Ernst Mach with his Darwinian interpretation of cognition, as well as Karl Buhler's notion of play fields,  and the evolutionary epistemology of Karl Popper,  paved the way for the multiple selection models a la Dennett emphasizing multiple selection models in Darwinian, Skinnerian, and Popperian creatures. 

The Darwinian heritage also   created many rivaling models of the genesis of the mind. The tension between qualitative and quantitative models was synthesized in the ethological approach of Konrad Lorenz, realizing the importance of species specific behaviors. A third Central European tradition, psychoanalysis was the fore runner in trying to connect the adaptive viewpoint and the notion of mental evolution to the tensions of individual development. That attitude is taken up by the most up to date Evo-Devo approaches to mental development.
